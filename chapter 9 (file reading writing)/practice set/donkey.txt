Once upon a time, there was a ###### who lived in a small village. The ###### was very hardworking, but people often laughed at the ###### because it looked clumsy. Every morning, the ###### carried heavy loads of firewood, and every evening, the ###### carried baskets of vegetables from the farm.
One day, the ###### met another ###### on the road. The first ###### said, “I am so tired.” The second ###### replied, “I am also tired, but a ###### must keep going.” Together, the two ######s walked side by side, sharing their burdens.
From that day on, whenever someone saw a ######, they remembered the story of the hardworking ###### who never gave up. And the ###### was no longer laughed at — the ###### was admired.
