#Reading and writing, basically interacting with a file in python is what this chapter is about.

#Whenever we run a python program, its loaded in the ram.
#It runs in the ram and then it vanishes. It doesn't persist.
#Data doesn't persist in volatile memory.
#It stays there temporarily and then it vanishes, but we dont want it to vanish so we store it in a file.
#We write the data in a file. (reading and writing the file concept).
#Those files are stored in a non volatile memory like hard disc, phone's memory and stuff like that.

#The random-access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program terminates.
#In order to persist the data forever, we use files.

#We use ram cause its very fast.
#Non volatile memories are not as fast as volatile.

#A python program can interact with the file by reading content from it and writing content to it.
